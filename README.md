## What is this project about?

It's a simple home page that helps you to launch common apps in your Microsoft 365 subscription. That's it!

Some more background info is available in [the launch post](https://www.perspectives.plus/p/i-created-a-better-office-com).

**Doesn't Microsoft offer this already?**

They used to - until Copilot took over everything. Today, when you visit a URL like office.com, you won't find your trusty Office applications there. You'll be greeted with Copilot chat and agents. There's not even the traditional waffle menu in the top left corner anymore.

**Wow, that's not great...**

Tell me about it. It's quite alright to launch new products and make GenAI available. It's another thing to [force it upon paying customers](https://www.perspectives.plus/p/use-the-forced-copilot).

## How is this built?

It's built with GenAI. Using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) and ChatGPT mostly.

**Hey! I thought you didn't want AI to take over everything?**

I use GenAI every day, for many things. There's a time & place for it. The bottom line is, we need to let people decide what's suitable for them. Instead of deciding that AI will replace them or all their tools.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

Plus anything else the AI generators added after this readme was written.

**Are you sure you know how to use these things...**

I'm sure I _don't_ know. I'm not a developer who has ever done traditional programming. I've been a citizen developer / low-code developer for the past 20 years. Working with business apps in the Microsoft ecosystem, like Dynamics 365 and Power Platform.

**Why are you here on GitHub then?**

Because I like exploring new tech and seeing how far I can get with it. Like it or not, vibe coding is a thing now. Our new Chatty AI overlords offer better tools for building apps than the earlier low-code GUI experiences did. At least when building for the public web, with no sensitive business data nor enterprise governance requirements.

**I've got some ideas on how this could be improved/fixed**

Awesome! Open an issue and let's see how this open source thing works.

## Further info

I write a weekly newsletter called [Perspectives on Power Platform](https://www.perspectives.plus/). "Brutally honest and cheerfully sarcastic insights on Microsoftâ€™s low-code and AI technology, business apps, and the business of software."

I work as a solopreneur and Power Platform Advisor at [Niiranen Advisory Oy](https://niiranenadvisory.com/). If you've got questions or needs around Microsoft business apps, low-code governance, licensing(!), then maybe I could help you.

Finally, I do social posts on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jukkaniiranen/), [Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/@jukkan) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jukkan.bsky.social). Opinions are my own and I've got plenty of them.
